This command can also be filtered using key-value pairs with the `--filter` flag. For example, to filter by the operating system or agent status, you can use:\n\n   ```\n   lacework agent list --filter 'os:Linux' --filter 'status:ACTIVE'\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter Options:**\n   The command supports several filter keys such as `agentVersion`, `hostname`, `status`, etc., allowing you to narrow down the list as needed. You can specify multiple filters using additional `--filter` flags.\n\nThis should help you retrieve the status of the agents effectively using the Lacework CLI.\n",
