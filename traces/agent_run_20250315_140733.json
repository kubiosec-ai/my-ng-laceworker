You can adjust the time range using the `--range`, `--start`, and `--end` flags.\n\n2. **Show Alert Details**:\n   - Once you have the alert ID from the list, you can show more details about a specific alert using:\n     ```bash\n     lacework alert show <alert_id>\n     ```\n   - This will provide detailed information about the alert for further inspection.\n\nThese commands will help you filter and view medium severity alerts easily using the Lacework CLI.\n",
