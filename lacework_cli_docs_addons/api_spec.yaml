      <H3>Conventions</H3>

        1. **Parameters:** Parameters follow the JSON conventions, i.e., camelcase or lowerCamelcase notation, for all parameter names in the  query, request and response bodies, for example, `startTime`, `endTime`. 

        2. **Data Types:** For the constant types of data sets, integrations, assets, and other resources, the convention is to use UpperCamelcase notation,  for example, `AlertChannels`, `AuditLogs`, `CloudActivities`. 

        3. **Response Schema:** A successful response returns either the HTTP 200 or 201 Status Code and a top-level property called `data`, which contains  the result in the JSON format. A response returning the HTTP 4xx or 5xx Status Code returns the top-level  property called `message`, which contains an error message. 

        4. `additionalProperties` **Keyword**: For all response schemas, the `additionalProperties` keyword is set to `true`. This means additional fields or properties can be added to responses in the future. For information about the `additionalProperties` keyword, see the [JSON Schema online  documentation](http://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#additional-properties). 


        <H3>Simple & Advanced Search</H3>

        The Lacework API provides simple and advanced searches for retrieving information.

        For simple searches, specify a HTTP GET method with simple query parameters, for example, `startTime`, `endTime`.

        For advanced searches, specify a HTTP POST method with filters in the request body. For a given endpoint, you can see what fields are available to filter on by viewing the response schema for the endpoint. The filters in requests that have multiple filters are `AND`'d, that is, all filters conditions must be met to satisfy a match. 

       There are 16 filter types consisting of seven pairs and two unique operators, which are similar to the SQL comparison operators for database queries. The pairs are: 

        * The `eq` operator allows you to specify a value that the field values of the result must be equal to. The `ne` operator means not equal to. Note the `value` field of the `filters` must be used; the `values` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `eq` and `ne`. 

        * The `in` operator allows you to specify multiple values in the `values` field of the `filters`. The field values of the result must match one of the values. The `not_in` operator is the opposite of `in`. Note the `value` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `in` and `not_in`. 

        * The `like` operator allows you to specify a pattern that the field values of the result must match. The `not_like` operator is the opposite of `like`. Note the `values` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `like` and `not_like`. 

        * The `ilike` operator works similar to `like` but it makes the match case insensitive. The `not_ilike` operator is the opposite of `ilike`. Note the `values` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `ilike` and `not_ilike`. 

        * The `rlike` operator matches the specified pattern represented by regular expressions (more info on [RLIKE — Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/rlike.html)). You can use `rlike` to filter object values in arrays, to return only those values that match a regular expression. The `not_rlike` operator is the opposite of `rlike`. Note the `values` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `rlike` and `not_rlike`. 

        * The `gt` operator allows you to specify a value that the field values of the result must be `greater than`. The `lt` (less-than) operator is the opposite of `gt`. Note the `values` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `gt` and `lt`. 

        * The `ge` operator allows you to specify a value that the field values of the result must be `greater than or equal to`. The `le` (less-than-or-equal-to) operator is the opposite of `ge`. Note the `values` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `ge` and `le`. 

        The unique operators are: 

        * The `between` operator allows you to specify a range that the field values of the result must be within. The specified upper boundary must be larger/greater than the lower boundary. The two values of upper and lower boundaries must be set in the `values` field of the `filters`. Note the `value` field of the `filters` cannot be used for `between`. 

        * The `expr` operator is reserved for future use.  


       <H3>Date & Time Formats</H3>

        For date and time parameters, the time zone is always UTC and the following formats are supported: 

        * `yyyy-MM-dd` for example, `2020-12-18` 

        * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH` for example, `2020-12-18T08`

        * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` for example `2020-12-18T08:00:00Z`

        * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` for example, `2020-12-18T08:00:00.000Z`


        <H3>Organization Level Access</H3> 

        An organization may have a primary account and multiple sub-accounts.  An access token generated for the primary account and used as the authorization token can also be used for one of the sub-accounts, with the additional header called `Account-Name` (case insensitive).

       For example, if the primary account is `xyz` and the sub-account is `xyz-sub1`, set the `Account-Name` header to `xyz-sub1`. 

       **Note:** Multiple sub-account and organizational-level access is limited to access tokens generated with regular user API keys. A service user has access to individual accounts only.

       To access organization-level data sets, you can use a header called `Org-Access` (case insensitive). If this header is set to `true` (case insensitive) and the authorization token has the proper permissions (org admin), if specified, the `Account-Name` header is ignored. If the `Org-Access` header is not set to `true`, the `Account-Name` header is used, if specified.


        <H3>Pagination</H3> 

       Making calls to Lacework APIs could return a lot of results. Pagination of the results helps manage overall performance and makes the responses easier for you to handle by dividing the results into separate pages, each with a subset of the results. 

       The following row limits apply: 

       * Row limit per page: 5,000 rows 

       * Row limit of all pages of one result set: 500,000 rows 


       Pagination is available for some datasets, such as those that are searched with the `/api/v2/Vulnerabilities/Containers/search` or `/api/v2/Entities/Machines/search` endpoints. 

       Pagination metadata is located within the response's `paging` field, which contains information for `rows`, `totalRows`, and `urls`. The `urls` field contains the `nextPage` field with the Next Page URL. The Next Page URLs stay valid for 24 hours. No pagination is available for an API if the `paging` field is missing from a response. 

       To get the next page of the result, use the entire Next Page URL and send a GET request with the two required HTTP headers: "Authorization: Bearer {YourAPIToken}" and "Content-Type: application/json". 

       Example: 

       > `GET https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Vulnerabilities/Containers/abcxyz...` 

       See the right panel for response examples. 


       <H3>Rate Limiting</H3> 

       The current rate limit is 480 API requests per hour per user. When the total number of API requests on a one-hour rolling window exceeds the rate limit, the HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response status code is returned. 

        Lacework uses the token bucket algorithm to apply request rate limiting. Each API v2 functionality has its own bucket with 480 tokens and each request that you make removes one token from the bucket. For example, performing a `GET /api/v2/AgentAccessTokens` or a `GET /api/v2/AgentAccessTokens/{ID}` are both part of one functionality, which gets an agent access token, so each request removes one token from the same bucket. Similarly, updating an agent access token (`PATCH /api/v2/AgentAccessTokens/{ID}`) is a different functionality and disregards the ID to use the same bucket, so a token is removed from a different bucket. 

       Each request sends back three response headers following standard HTTP naming conventions for rate limiting. `RateLimit-Limit` is the total number of requests you can make in an hour, `RateLimit-Remaining` is the number of remaining requests, and `RateLimit-Reset` is how much time it will take (in seconds) before you can make another request once the limit is reached. For more information about `RateLimit` header fields, see [IETF Draft 05](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-05.html). 


         <H3>POST Body Size Limit</H3> 

       Many Lacework API endpoints accept data as POST body content. POST body content is limited to 1 MB. Requests that exceed the 1 MB limit result in a 400 Bad Request error. 


       <H3>Response Status Codes</H3> 

       The Lacework API endpoints return the following HTTP response status codes. 

        <TABLE> <TR> <TH>Status Code</TH><TH>Definition</TH><TH>Description</TH> </TR>  <TR> <TD> 200 </TD><TD> OK </TD><TD> The request has succeeded. </TD> </TR>  <TR> <TD> 201 </TD><TD> Created </TD><TD> The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. </TD> </TR>  <TR> <TD> 204 </TD><TD> No Content </TD><TD> The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body. </TD> </TR>  <TR> <TD> 400 </TD><TD> Bad Request </TD><TD> The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.

       The Team Users API works with the new Lacework role-based access control (RBAC) model. After you enable RBAC in the Lacework Console, the Team Users API is available and the legacy Team Members API (deprecated) is disabled. For more information on the legacy API, see the [Team Members APIs](https://docs.lacework.com/api/v2/docs/#tag/TeamMembers). 

       The Team Users API works with users and groups at the account level only; organization-level users are not supported. For information on working with account level users in the Lacework Console, see [Access Control at Account Level](https://docs.lacework.com/onboarding/access-control-account-level). 

      The Lacework RBAC model defines two types of users: standard users and
      service users. Standard user accounts are typically associated with
      specific people in your organization, while service users are often shared
      among people and typically represent a service, client, or other type of
      programmatic Lacework integration.

       **AWS Cloud Trail** 

       For the file parameter, specify AwsCloudTrail to download an AWS CloudTrail CloudFormation template for configuring an AWS CloudTrail integration to monitor cloud account security. 

       **AWS EKS Audit Logs** 

       For the file parameter, specify AwsEksAudit to download an AWS EKS Audit Log template for configuring resources to allow monitoring of Kubernetes runtime security using audit logs on EKS [(Step 1)](https://docs.lacework.com/eks-audit-log-integration-overview#what-happens-during-step-1). 

       For the file parameter, specify AwsEksAuditSubscriptionFilter to download an AWS EKS Audit Log template for configuring an EKS cluster log group to monitor EKS runtime security. Optionally pass in `intgGuid` as a query parameter. This allows the intgGuid to get the SNS ARN, create the firehose ARN, and insert that into the template before returning it. This means you don't have to find the firehoseARN and insert it manually. Obtain the integration's intgGuid by using the `GET https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/CloudAccounts` endpoint [(Step 2)](https://docs.lacework.com/eks-audit-log-integration-overview#what-happens-during-step-2). 

       After downloading the template, you must upload and run the template file in the AWS Console. For information about setting up AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config integrations, see [AWS Integration Using CloudFormation](https://docs.lacework.net/onboarding/aws-integration-with-cloudformation). For information on EKS Audit Log integration, see [EKS Audit Log Integration](https://docs.lacework.com/onboarding/eks-audit-log-integration-overview).

          Get the agent access token id by calling the `GET /api/v2/AgentAccessTokens` endpoint.

          Replace `{id}` with the long hexadecimal access token identifier returned in the `accessToken` field of the `GET /api/v2/AgentAccessTokens` endpoint response.

          Here is an example `body` payload:

      description: >-
        The Agent Information API enables you to retrieve information about all
        agents by invoking the following endpoint:

          > `POST /api/v2/AgentInfo/search`
         
         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days.  To use the current time as the end time, exclude the endTime field.

         You can optionally filter the information returned by agent status, agent version, IP address, and more. For details about what agent information is available, see [AGENT_MANAGEMENT_V View](https://docs.lacework.com/console/agentmanagementv-view). 

          Here are some example `body` payloads: 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime" : "2022-04-28T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2022-04-28T18:00:00Z"},` 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": " 2022-04-28T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2022-04-28T18:00:00Z"},`
         `"filters" : [ { "field": "status", "expression": "eq", "value": "ACTIVE" }, { "field": "tags.VmProvider", "expression": "eq", "value" : "AWS" } ],`  
         `"returns": [ "hostname", "ipAddr", "os" , "agentVersion", "status" ] }` 


         Within request bodies, nested field names that contain one or more special characters—e.g., dot ("."), colon (":"), or slash ("/")—must be enclosed in **escaped double quotes**. For example, the field name `aws:ec2launchtemplate:version` nested under the `tags` field would be rendered as follows: 

         `"tags.\"aws:ec2launchtemplate:version\""` 

         In a filter, the example would appear as follows: 

         `{ "field": "tags.\"aws:ec2launchtemplate:version\"", "expression": "eq", "value": "3" }` 

         In addition, forward slash characters within field names must be escaped with a backslash, as in the following example: 

         `"tags.\"kubernetes.io\/cluster\/prod1\""`

        Get a list of alerts during the specified date range by invoking the
        following endpoint:

         > `GET https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Alerts?startTime={startTime}&endTime={endTime}` 

         Use the following formats to specify the `startTime` and `endTime`:

         * `yyyy-MM-dd` for example, `2022-06-28` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH` for example, `2022-06-28T08` 

         *  `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` for example, `2022-06-28T08:00:00Z` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` for example, `2022-06-28T08:00:00.000Z` 


         Here is an example invocation: 

         > `GET https://YourLacework.lacework .net/api/v2/Alerts?startTime=2022-06-30T00:00:00Z&endTime=2022-06-30T08:00:00Z`  

         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days. 

         Pagination metadata is located within the response's `paging` field, which contains information for `rows`, `totalRows`, and `urls`. The `urls` field contains the `nextPage` field with the Next Page URL. The Next Page URLs stay valid for 24 hours. 

         To get the next page of the result, use the entire Next Page URL and send a GET request with the two required HTTP headers: "Authorization: Bearer {YourAPIToken}" and "Content-Type: application/json". 

         Example: 

         > `GET https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Alerts/abcxyz123...`

         Optionally specify filters in the request body. For more information about using filters, see the [Simple & Advanced Search section](/api/v2/docs/#tag/OVERVIEW).

         For the `timeFilter` filter, these are the supported time formats:

         * `yyyy-MM-dd` for example, `2022-07-08` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH` for example, `2022-07-08T08` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` for example, `2022-07-08T08:00:00Z` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` for example, `2022-07-08T08:00:00.000Z` 


         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days.  To use the current time as the end time, exclude the endTime field.

         To limit the returned result, optionally specify one or more filters in the request body. These fields can be set in the filters: `alertId`, `alertType`, `severity`, `status`, `subCategory`, `category`, and `source`. In the filter, specify the field on which to filter, the `eq` operator, and the value against which the field value is compared.

         You can optionally filter the returned alerts by one or more of the top-level fields. See [Filter Alerts](https://docs.lacework.com/console/filter-alerts) for the filter values. 

         Here are some example `body` payloads: 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": "2022-07-08T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2022-07-08T08:00:00Z"},` 
         `"filters": [ { "field": "alertType", "expression": "eq", "value": "SuspiciousUserFailedLogin" } ] }` 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": "2022-07-08T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2022-07-08T08:00:00Z"},` 
         `"filters": [ { "field": "severity", "expression": "eq", "value": "Critical" }, { "field": "status", "expression": "eq", "value": "Open" } ],`  
         `"returns": [ "alertId", "alertName", "alertType", "alertInfo" ] }` 


         Pagination metadata is located within the response's `paging` field, which contains information for `rows`, `totalRows`, and `urls`. The `urls` field contains the `nextPage` field with the Next Page URL. The Next Page URLs stay valid for 24 hours.

          * `yyyy-MM-dd` for example, `2020-12-18` 

          * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH` for example, `2020-12-18T08` 

          * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` for example, `2020-12-18T08:00:00Z`

        Search cloud activities by invoking the following endpoint:

          > `POST https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/CloudActivities/search` 

         Optionally specify filters in the request body. For more information about using filters, see the [Simple & Advanced Search section](/api/v2/docs/#tag/OVERVIEW).

         For the `timeFilter` filter, these are the supported time formats:

         * `yyyy-MM-dd` for example, `2021-12-18` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH` for example, `2021-12-18T08` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` for example, `2021-12-18T08:00:00Z` 

         * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` for example, `2021-12-18T08:00:00.000Z`

         The `rlike` and `not_rlike` operators are useful for filtering results. For example, the following expression limits results to the `CreateTags` API:

         > `"filters": [ { "expression": "rlike", "field": "entityMap.API", "value": ".CreateTags." } ]`  

         Here is another example that shows how to limit results to those with the numeric pattern specified as the resource ID:

         > `"filters": [ { "expression": "rlike", "field": "entityMap.Resource",  "value": ".3\.0\.529\.0." } ]` 

         Here are some additional example `body` payloads: 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": "2021-12-11T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2021-12-12T00:00:00Z"},`

        status, violated resources, reason, recommendation, account info, etc.)

        following endpoint:

          > `POST https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Configs/ComplianceEvaluations/search` 

         The search results include details about compliance violations identified by cloud assessments for all supported and configured cloud provider types: AWS, Azure, and GCP.

         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days. 

         You must specify a dataset. The possible datasets are `AwsCompliance`, `AzureCompliance`, `GcpCompliance`, and `K8sCompliance`. You can optionally filter the compliance evaluations by report time, account, section, ID, and more. For more information, see [CLOUD_COMPLIANCE_V View](https://docs.lacework.com/cloudcompliancev-view).

      summary: Search Containers
      description: >-
        Search for containers in your environment. Get details, such as the
        container name, pod name, tags, and so on, by invoking the following
        endpoint:  

          > `POST https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Entities/Containers/search` 

         The results reflect containers that were active within the specified time frame. Containers that were not active do not appear in the results. 

         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days.  To use the current time as the end time, exclude the endTime field.

         You can optionally filter the returned containers by the container name, pod name, tags, and more. For more information, see [CONTAINER_SUMMARY_V View](https://docs.lacework.com/containersummaryv-view). 

         Here are some example `body` payloads: 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": "2021-08-28T20:30:00Z", "endTime": "2021-08-28T22:30:00Z"}}`
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": "2021-08-28T20:30:00Z", "endTime": "2021-08-28T22:30:00Z"},` 
         `"filters": [ { "field": "mid", "expression": "eq", "value": "12345" } ] }` 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime": "2021-08-28T20:30:00Z", "endTime": "2021-08-28T22:30:00Z"},`

         `"returns": [ "containerName", "imageId", "podName", "propsContainer", "tags" ] }` 


         Within request bodies, nested field names that contain one or more special characters—e.g., dot ("."), colon (":"), or slash ("/")—must be enclosed in **escaped double quotes**. For example, the field name `io.codefresh.repo.name` nested under the `PROPS_LABEL` of the `propsContainer` field would be rendered as follows: 

         `"propsContainer.PROPS_LABEL.\"io.codefresh.repo.name\""` 

          In a filter, the example would appear as follows:

      description: >-
        The Inventory API enables you to retrieve information about resources in
        your cloud integrations, such as virtual machines, S3 buckets, security
        groups, and more, using the following endpoint:  

         > `POST /api/v2/Inventory/search` 

        By default, Lacework collects resource information once a day. You can
        view and modify when resource  collection starts using the Compliance
        Report Schedule
        [setting](https://docs.lacework.com/console/general-settings#resource-management-collection-schedule). 

         The time filter allows you to see your resource inventory at a specific point of time. When using the Inventory API, keep in mind that the information returned reflects the inventory when the resource collector last ran within the specified time range. If you use a recent time range that does not encompass the last time inventory collection occurred, the query returns an empty array. In this case, expand the time span to include the last collection time. 

         For details about what cloud resource information is available, see [CLOUD_CONFIGURATION_V View](https://docs.lacework.com/console/cloudconfigurationv-view). 

         The `rlike` and `not_rlike` operators are useful for filtering results. For example, if the result contains the security group ID `sg-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h` in the path `resourceConfig.SecurityGroups.GroupId`, and `SecurityGroups` is an array, you can filter by ID for that pattern as follows:

         > `"filters" : [ {"field":"resourceConfig","expression": "rlike", "value":".*sg-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h.*" } ]`   

         Here are additional example `body` payloads: 
         * `{ "timeFilter": { "startTime" : "2022-06-08T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2022-06-10T12:00:00Z"},`

      summary: Scan Inventory
      description: >+
        Trigger a [resource
        scan](https://docs.lacework.com/console/resource-explorer). By default,
        Lacework scans cloud integrations in order to generate or update its
        resource inventory [once a
        day](https://docs.lacework.com/console/general-settings#resource-management-collection-schedule).
        This endpoint lets you trigger scans manually. This endpoint is useful,
        for example, after you have onboarded a new cloud integration and want
        to start collecting and evaluating resources from the system
        immediately. Manual scans can be run one hour after the last scan has
        completed. 

          Usage Example: 

          > `curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  "https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Inventory/scan?csp=AWS"  -H "Authorization: Bearer YourAPIToken"`

          > `POST https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Vulnerabilities/Containers/search` 

         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days.  To use the current time as the end time, exclude the endTime field.

         You can optionally filter returned vulnerabilities by severity, vulnerability ID, machine ID, and more. For more information, see [CONTAINER_VULN_DETAILS_V View](https://docs.lacework.com/containervulndetailsv-view). 

         The `rlike` and `not_rlike` operators are useful for filtering results. For example, the following expression limits results to those that have `python` in their `featureKey` name field:

         > `"filters": [ {  "expression": "rlike", "field": "featureKey.name", "value": ".*python.*" } ]`

        To search for container vulnerabilities of only active containers, first
        use the "Search Containers" endpoint to get a list of active containers.
        Then call "Search Container Vulnerabilities" and pass the image IDs from

        Request that Lacework scans (evaluates) for vulnerabilities in the
        specified container image. Specify the container image by passing in a
        tag, repository, and registry in the body parameter. You must specify a
        container image and repository located in a registry domain that has
        already been integrated with Lacework.  

         For registries that are integrated using the Lacework generic `Docker V2 Registry` type, vulnerability scans can be started only by calling this API operation. 

          For registries that are integrated using any Lacework registry type except *"Docker V2 Registry"*, vulnerability scans start when the container registry is initially integrated, when specified by the default scan schedule, or when this operation is called. 

          For more information, see https://docs.lacework.com/container-vulnerability-assessment-overview. 

           For more information about creating an API access key and token to run this operation and using this operation with organization resources, see https://docs.lacework.com/generate-api-access-keys-and-tokens. 

          Usage Example: 

          > `curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "registry": "index.docker.io", "repository":  "yourDockerOrg/yourRepository", "tag": "yourTag" }' "https://YourLacework.lacework.net/api/v2/Vulnerabilities/Containers/scan"  -H "Authorization: Bearer YourAPIToken"` 

         In the JSON body, do not prefix the registry or the repository with the `http://` string. 

           This operation returns a unique requestId in the response that you can use to track the status of this scan/assessment.

         Lacework highly recommends specifying a time range. Without a specified time range, the request uses the default time range of 24 hours prior to the current time. The maximum time range per API request is 7 days. 

         Optionally filter the returned vulnerabilities by severity, vulnerability ID, machine ID, and more. For more information, see [HOST_VULN_DETAILS_V View](https://docs.lacework.com/hostvulndetailsv-view). 

         The `rlike` and `not_rlike` operators are useful for filtering results. For example, the following expression limits results to those that have `python` in their `featureKey` name field:

         > `"filters": [ {  "expression": "rlike", "field": "featureKey.name", "value": ".*python.*" } ]` 

         Here are some additional example `body` payloads:

         `"returns": [ "mid", "props", "severity", "status", "vulnId", "evalCtx", "fixInfo", "featureKey", "machineTags" ] }` 


         Within request bodies, nested field names that contain one or more special characters—e.g., dot ("."), colon (":"), or slash ("/")—mus be enclosed in **escaped double quotes**. For example, the field name `aws:ec2launchtemplate:version` nested under the `machineTags` field would be rendered as follows: 

         `"machineTags.\"aws:ec2launchtemplate:version\""` 

         In a filter, the example would appear as follows: 

         `{ "field": "machineTags.\"aws:ec2launchtemplate:version\"", "expression": "eq", "value": "3" }` 

         In addition, forward slash characters within field names must be escaped with a backslash, as in the following example: 

         `"machineTags.\"kubernetes.io\/cluster\/prod1\""` 

        To search for host vulnerabilities of only online machines, first use
        the "Search Machines" endpoint to get a list of online machines. Then
        call "Search Host Vulnerabilities", passing the machine IDs from the
        "Search Machines" results as a filter with the `in` filter type.

                    If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host,
                    and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet
                    can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds
                    read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the
                    crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users
                    should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can
                    be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled
                    that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.
