2025-03-15 13:55:50,290 - INFO - Found relevant information: To list all Lacework agents and show their status, you can use the following Lacework CLI command:

```bash
lacework agent list
```

This command will list all hosts with a running Lacework agent and can include various details such as `agentVersion`, `hostname`, `ipAddr`, `status`, and more. You can also use filters to narrow down the results, for example:

```bash
lacework agent list --filter 'status:ACTIVE'
```

This will only show agents that are active.
