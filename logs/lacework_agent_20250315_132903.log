2025-03-15 13:29:11,697 - INFO - Found relevant information: To configure Lacework to monitor an AWS account, you can use the `lacework compliance aws` command. This allows you to manage compliance reports for AWS and list all AWS accounts configured in your Lacework account using the command:

```bash
lacework compliance aws list-accounts
```

You can also trigger a new resource inventory scan with:

```bash
lacework compliance aws scan
```

To handle email alerts for compliance violations, you can manage report rules using `lacework report-rule`. This includes creating a report rule to route reports to one or more email alert channels. The key steps are:

1. Define email alert channel(s) for the report.
2. Specify severities to include.
3. Select resource group(s).
4. Choose notification types for the report.

To create a new report rule, use:

```bash
lacework report-rule create
```

These commands and concepts should help you set up AWS account monitoring and configure email alerts for compliance issues.
