2025-03-15 14:02:47,161 - INFO - Found relevant information: To list all Lacework agents and show their status, you can use the `lacework agent list` command. This command lists all hosts with a running Lacework agent in your environment. You can also use filters with key-value pairs to narrow down the specific agents you want to view, such as filtering by `agentVersion`, `status`, or other attributes like `os` and `hostname`. 

Here is an example command:

```bash
lacework agent list --filter 'status:ACTIVE'
```

This command will list all agents that are currently active. You can adjust the filters according to the information you need.
