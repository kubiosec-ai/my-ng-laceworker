2025-03-15 14:07:40,296 - INFO - Found relevant information: To view the latest medium alert using the Lacework CLI, you can use the `lacework alert list` command with appropriate flags to filter by severity level. Here's how to do it:

1. **List Alerts**:
   - Use the command to list the alerts filtered by severity "medium":
     ```bash
     lacework alert ls --severity medium
     ```
   - By default, this command shows alerts from the last 24 hours. You can adjust the time range using the `--range`, `--start`, and `--end` flags.

2. **Show Alert Details**:
   - Once you have the alert ID from the list, you can show more details about a specific alert using:
     ```bash
     lacework alert show <alert_id>
     ```
   - This will provide detailed information about the alert for further inspection.

These commands will help you filter and view medium severity alerts easily using the Lacework CLI.
