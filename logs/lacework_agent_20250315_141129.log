2025-03-15 14:11:35,019 - INFO - Found relevant information: To list all medium alerts from the last week using the Lacework CLI, you can use the following command:

```bash
lacework alert ls --severity medium --range "last 7 days" --json
```

This command filters alerts by medium severity and sets the timeframe to the last 7 days, while using the `--json` flag to ensure the output is in JSON format.
