2025-03-15 13:46:29,679 - INFO - Found relevant information: To list all Lacework agents and show their status, you can use the following commands in the Lacework CLI:

1. **List All Agents:**
   Use the command `lacework agent list` to list all hosts that have a running agent. This command can also be filtered using key-value pairs with the `--filter` flag. For example, to filter by the operating system or agent status, you can use:

   ```
   lacework agent list --filter 'os:Linux' --filter 'status:ACTIVE'
   ```

2. **Filter Options:**
   The command supports several filter keys such as `agentVersion`, `hostname`, `status`, etc., allowing you to narrow down the list as needed. You can specify multiple filters using additional `--filter` flags.

This should help you retrieve the status of the agents effectively using the Lacework CLI.
