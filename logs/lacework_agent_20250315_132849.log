2025-03-15 13:28:55,252 - INFO - Found relevant information: To list all Lacework agents and show their status, you can use the following command in the Lacework CLI:

```bash
lacework agent list
```

This command lists all hosts that have a running agent in your environment. You can also use `--filter` flags to refine results based on specific attributes, such as:

- `agentVersion`
- `status` (e.g., `ACTIVE`)
- `hostname`
- `os`

For example, to list agents with a specific version and status, you can use:

```bash
lacework agent list --filter 'agentVersion:5.8.0.*' --filter 'status:ACTIVE'
```

This command allows you to filter the results by various key-value pairs, offering flexibility in querying agent information.
