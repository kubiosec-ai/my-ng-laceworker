2025-03-15 13:53:56,346 - INFO - Found relevant information: To list all Lacework agents and show their status using the Lacework CLI, you can use the `lacework agent list` command. This command will list all hosts that have a running agent in your environment. You can filter the list of agents based on various parameters such as `agentVersion`, `hostname`, `status`, and more, using the `--filter` flag. For example, to filter hosts with a running agent version '5.8.0' and status 'ACTIVE', you would use:

```bash
lacework agent list --filter 'agentVersion:5.8.0.*' --filter 'status:ACTIVE'
```

The command supports multiple keys for filtering, including:

- `agentVersion`
- `hostname`
- `status`

You can also utilize regular expressions for the filter values.
